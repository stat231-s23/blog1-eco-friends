# STAT 231 Blog project template

The `index.Rmd` file holds all of the code and information for our blog. The following files were used in preparation for our visualizations: `DQ,MCD,SON_Clusters.Rmd` (Cora), `SUB_TB_Clusters.Rmd` (Wendy), and `ARB,CHI,BUR.Rmd` (Sophia). Lastly, `DataWrangling_Test.Rmd` holds our data wrangling code. 

The `data` folder holds our wrangled data and our original, messy data (in a subfolder titled messydata).

A comment on who did which parts: Instead of labeling each line of code (since there is a lot of code) we each worked on different restaurants and collaborated on ideas and helped each other plan. Sophia worked on Arbys, Burger King, and Chick-Fil-A, Cora worked on Dairy queen, McDonald's, and Sonic, and Wendy worked on Subway and Taco Bell as well as the map of fast food locations.
